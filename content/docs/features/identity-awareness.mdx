description: How gitswitch learns which identity to use per repository
---

This page covers how gitswitch tracks per-repo identity usage, when it nudges you to switch, and how pinning overrides the auto-recommender.

## How learning works

Every time you enter a git repo (via the shell nudge hook), gitswitch calls `gitswitch record` to increment a usage counter for the active profile under that repo's key.

The repo key is resolved from `git remote get-url origin`. If no remote exists, it falls back to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (the absolute repo root path). This means two clones of the same repo at different paths are tracked separately.

History is stored in `~/.config/gitswitch/history.json`:

```json
{
  "repos": {
    "git@github.com:company/api.git": {
      "identities": { "work": 14, "personal": 1 },
      "last_used": "work"
    }
  }
}
```

## Recommendation threshold

gitswitch recommends a profile when all three conditions are true:

1. The top identity has **≥ 3** recorded entries for that repo
2. The top identity holds **≥ 60%** of all entries for that repo
3. The top identity differs from the currently active profile

If a repo has a pin set, the pin always wins — the threshold is ignored.

## Shell nudge

With [shell integration](/docs/features/shell) installed, entering a git repo triggers:

```bash
gitswitch recommend
```

If a recommendation is available, the shell hook displays:

```
gitswitch: this repo usually uses work <alice@company.com> — switch? [y/N]
```

Press `y` to switch, `n` or `Enter` to skip. The nudge is non-blocking.

## Pin a repo

Pinning requires [Session Isolation](shell.md#session-isolation) (on by default via `gitswitch install`) — a pin only takes effect while it's on, and pinning turns it on automatically if it was off.

Pinning sets the identity for one repo permanently, instead of asking you to switch globally every time you enter it:

```bash
cd ~/work/api
gitswitch pin work
```

```
Pinned 'work' to this repo — Alice Smith <alice@company.com> (local git config, global identity untouched)
```

The pin is written to the repo's own `.git/config` (`user.name`, `user.email`, `user.signingkey`/`gpg.format`, `core.sshCommand`) — git's local scope always beats the global one, so commits in this repo use that identity even while another profile is active everywhere else. It is the same thing as running `git config --local user.email …` by hand, just with your whole profile applied at once.

Everything else follows the repo automatically, so git and GitHub never disagree about who you are:

- **gh CLI** — pinning switches `gh` to that profile's account, and entering the repo later switches it back (the shell hook keeps it in step).
- **HTTPS pushes** — the credential helper serves this repo's tokens from the pinned account.
- **Prompt and `gitswitch current`** — both report the repo's identity while you are inside it, not the global one, and mark it as pinned (see [Telling the scopes apart](#telling-the-scopes-apart)).

Your globally active profile is the one thing left alone — pinning one repo should not change what every other repo does.

Since the repo already commits correctly, the shell hook does not nudge you when you enter it.

A repo whose local `user.email` merely repeats your global one is not treated as pinned — it overrides nothing, so gitswitch leaves the nudges on and shows no marker.

### Pinning from the TUI

Inside the TUI, `p` pins the highlighted profile to the repo you launched it from, and pressing `p` again on the pinned profile releases it. `enter` always means the same thing it ever did — change your **global** identity — so the two never get confused.

The key only appears in the footer when you are actually inside a git repo.

### Telling the scopes apart

Three things can decide who you commit as. Both the TUI and the shell prompt mark which one is in play:

| Marker | Scope | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| `✓` | global identity | `~/.gitconfig` — the profile you last switched to |
| `●` | pinned to this repo | the repo's own `.git/config` |
| `◉` | pinned to this repo **and** your global identity | both agree |
| `◆` | this terminal's session | environment variables (see below) |

In the shell prompt the same markers ride next to the nickname — `[work]` for global, `[work●]` in a pinned repo. Nothing is added when you are on your global identity, so a setup with no pins looks exactly as it always did.

The session marker (`◆`) appears when git config environment variables override both your repo and your global config — for example a terminal launched with `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`/`GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0`/`GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0` set. Anything started from that terminal, including AI coding agents, inherits it. First-class commands for this are on the roadmap; gitswitch already reports it correctly today.

### Repos you already configured by hand

If a repo already has its own `user.email` (set with `git config --local` long before gitswitch), run `pin` with no nickname to adopt it:

```bash
gitswitch pin
```

```
Adopted this repo's existing identity <alice@company.com>
Pinned 'work' to this repo — Alice Smith <alice@company.com> (local git config; global identity unchanged)
```

gitswitch matches the email to a stored profile and fills in the rest (signing key, SSH key, gh account). Repos like this are recognised even without a pin: the prompt, credential helper, and gh account all follow the local identity, and no nudge appears. Passing a nickname over an existing local identity tells you what it is replacing before it does so.

Remove the pin:

```bash
gitswitch unpin
```

```
Unpinned — this repo now uses the global identity
```

This removes those keys from the repo's local config. Both commands require you to be inside a git repo.

## Manually check what would be recommended

```bash
gitswitch recommend
```

- Exits `0` and prints `nickname\tname\temail` if a recommendation exists
- Exits `1` silently if already on the right identity, no history, or threshold not met

```bash
gitswitch recommend --path ~/work/api
```

Use `--path` to check a different directory without `cd`ing into it.

## Record usage manually

```bash
gitswitch record
```

Records the currently active profile for the current directory. The shell hook calls this automatically — you rarely need to run it by hand.

## Reset history

To clear all learned history:

```bash
rm ~/.config/gitswitch/history.json
```

To remove the pin for the current repo without clearing all history:

```bash
gitswitch unpin
```

## Troubleshooting

**Nudges are not appearing when I `cd` into repos**

1. Confirm shell integration is installed: `gitswitch install`
2. Reload your shell: `source ~/.zshrc` or open a new terminal
3. Confirm you're inside a git repo: `git rev-parse --git-dir`
4. Check usage counts: `cat ~/.config/gitswitch/history.json`

The threshold requires ≥ 3 entries with ≥ 60% share. If you've visited fewer than 3 times with a consistent identity, no nudge appears yet.

**Wrong profile is being suggested**

The recommendation reflects the most-used identity based on recorded history. If the data is stale or incorrect, edit or delete `~/.config/gitswitch/history.json` to clear it.
